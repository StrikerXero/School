/***  Tip!
*In order to get what you want from CSS, you can take many approaches
*and solve the problem many ways. The curriculum is not and can never 
*be the final source for all things programming. In this project, you 
*are asked to use a 'sticky footer'. This requirement is not a new
*concept, but it is a combination of basic attributes that produce
*the result. Think of this requirement as something that you need to
*think through to find a solution. Always be ready to Google something
*when you run into something you haven't seen before!
